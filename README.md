# vertica_collaboration
This repo is to share scripts/ best practices for developers/ administrators in collaboration with Vertica Staff Enginners.
This repo is not a substitute for Vertica Support/ Staff engineer advice and should not be treated as such.
You are strongly advised to review and test the scripts in a smaller development environment to understand how they work.
You should also be aware that Vertica may change implementation over version upgrade. For this reason, you should check if the scripts are still relevant to your version or if there is a better way to do the same.
